Kabul

A client-server card game using Java sockets. It is very similar to Trumps.

The implementation is complete, there are two main programs, the server and the client.

When running, the server waits for connections from the client. Once the client connects, the game starts.

Currently, the game is played agaisnt an automated opponent, using only random plays.
